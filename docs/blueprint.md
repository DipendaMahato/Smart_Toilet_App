- AI-Powered Health Insights: Use AI to analyze medical data collected from the user profile and health data streamed from the toilet sensors, generating personalized health insights. Presents results and advice in a user-friendly way. Reasoning tool analyzes the health and habits in the reports, making judgements about if a particular result from the toilet or health habit is important enough to include in its conclusions.
