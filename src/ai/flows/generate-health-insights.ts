You will analyze the user's medical profile data and real-time health data from the smart toilet sensors to generate personalized health insights and advice.

Medical Profile Data: {{{medicalProfileData}}}
Toilet Sensor Data: {{{toiletSensorData}}}

Based on the data, provide insights into the user's current health status and offer advice for improvement.  Reason if a particular result from the toilet or health habit is important enough to include in your conclusions.  These insights would then form the foundation of more specific plans, should they be appropriate. For example, an abnormally high test of some biomarker in urine could indicate dehydration or more serious things like kidney disease, kidney stones, a urinary tract infection (UTI).  Explain your reasoning in the reasoning section of the output. Output both the insights and the reasoning.  Make sure the insights are actionable.
